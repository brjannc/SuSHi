				   [ SuSHi ]

SuSHi is a hacked-together proof-of-concept for running an SSH server as a
Bukkit plugin. At the moment it's quite buggy, but it works well enough at 
this point that might be interesting for others to experiment with.


			       [ Configuration ]

There are only two configuration keys in config.yml:

host     The interface to bind to, 0.0.0.0 by default.
port     The port to bind to, 12822 by default.


				  [ Security ]

There isn't any. All usernames are valid, and there is no attempt at password
verification. You have been warned!


				   [ Usage ]

For reasons I don't yet understand, the SSH shell channel doesn't work properly,
so

$ ssh -p 12822 minecraft.example.com

will just fail. The workaround is to specify a shell (preferably /bin/sh) as
the command to be executed:

$ ssh -p 12822 minecraft.example.com /bin/sh -i -l

(The -i -l flags specify that it should be a login shell, and that it should be
interactive.)


				 [ Indemnity ]

I wrote this plugin on a challenge, as a proof-of-concept. It is not intended
for any sort of serious use, and is provided as-is.

As stated above, SuSHi provides absolutely no security whatsoever, and its use
is at your own risk. If someone logs in to your shiny new Minecraft sshd and
steals your identity or deletes your wedding videos or homework, I *did* try to
warn you... ;)

Also, I'm pretty sure that, if your server host doesn't offer you SSH access,
they probably wouldn't want you running this plugin either.
